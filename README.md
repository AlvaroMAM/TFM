## Abstract
Due to advance in quantum computing, it results more interesting to incorporate this new computing
paradigm in the creation of hybrid systems in which both models, classical and quantum coexist. 
A way of coexistence between both ofthem, is by using microservices architecture. In classical computing
there are some tools and methodologies that allow the creation of optimal distribution of this kind of applications.
Nevertheless, there is a lack of tools and methodologies for hybrid (classical-quantum) applications to
realize an optimal distribution. Given this context, this Master's Thesis presents a first tool to approach the distribution of hybrid applications. The objective of this project is to serve as a first approximation to achieve a more complete tool for realizing optimal distributions of quantum-classical applications. This new tool uses modelchecking techniques and utility's theory to obtain a cost-performance optimal deployment. For doing that, the tools follows the next workflow, starting with the app' specification and ending with an optimal distribution of the microservices that compose the hybrid application. This tools uses classical computing techniques to resolve the optimal deployment of classical-quantum application problem resulting a novel contribution that facilitates the advance in the development of hybrid systems and applications.
